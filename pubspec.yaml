  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env.dev
    - .env.prod
    - assets/images/core/
    - assets/images/icons/
    - lang/ar.json
    - lang/en.json

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    # Arabic Font
    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/arabic/cairo/Cairo-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/arabic/cairo/Cairo-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/arabic/cairo/Cairo-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
    # English Font
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
